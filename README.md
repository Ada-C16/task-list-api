# Task List API

There's so much we want to do in the world! When we organize our goals into smaller, bite-sized tasks, we'll be able to track them more easily, and complete them. 

This is a simple web API to organize one's tasks. One can create, read, update, and delete tasks. One can also:
- Sort tasks
- Mark them as complete
- Get feedback about one's task list through Slack (this API integrates with Slack's API)
- Organize tasks under specific goals
- ... and more!
