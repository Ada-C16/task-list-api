# Task List API

## Deployed API

Task List is deployed on Heroku: https://much-wow-app.herokuapp.com/tasks

## Technologies
I used `Python`, `Flask` ((including Migrate and Alembic), `SQLAlchemy`, `PostgreSQL`, `Postman`, `Heroku`

## Overview

There's so much we want to do in the world! When we organize our goals into smaller, bite-sized tasks, we'll be able to track them more easily, and complete them!

With Task List, we'll be able to create, read, update, and delete tasks as long as we have access to the Internet and our API is running!

This app is able to:

- Sort tasks
- Mark them as complete
- Get feedback about our task list through Slack
- Organize tasks with goals

... and more!

## Behavior and Structure

- Create models
- Create conventional RESTful CRUD routes for a model
- Read query parameters to create custom behavior
- Create unconventional routes for custom behavior
- Apply knowledge about making requests in Python, to call an external API (Slack) inside of an API
- Apply knowledge about environment variables
- Creating a one-to-many relationship between two models
- Write unit tests
